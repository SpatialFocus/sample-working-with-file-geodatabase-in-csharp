> Working with geospatial data can be tricky without proper tools and guidelines. Years ago I have been working on a project with the task to analyze and handle raster and vector datasets. Back then the only supported vector-format was ESRI Shapefile, so the .NET library DotSpatial looked quite promising and was working well until now. However this package was not updated in the last few years, also new requirements like .NET Core, potentially Linux support and File Geodatabase support required some rethinking.
